## ReadMe File

## I worked with a learning instructor during this homework. He helped me think of questions in a simpler manner and demonstrated how to shorten code.
## For some questions, I did not use the starter code, but if required, I can go back and show how to create a data frame that way

## For the final part, I looked at previous class examples for code, and since it was repetitive, I solved the last 3 questions the same way.
